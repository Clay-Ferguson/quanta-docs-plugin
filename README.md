# Documents Plugin for Quanta Platform

This project provides docs functionality to the **Quanta Platform**, and can only be run inside the [Quanta Platform](https://github.com/Clay-Ferguson/quanta). This Documents management app (and any plugin) can be run along side any of the other plugins simply by dropping in a folder. All that's required to run this plugin (or any other one) is to checkout the Quanta Platform first, and then checkout this docs plugin into folder `/plugins/docs` if the Quanta Platform. There's a `.gitignore` entry for the entire `plugins` folder so that the projects (plugins vs core platform) code can be all in the same folder structure, during development and product builds, while maintaining complete separation of all projects.
