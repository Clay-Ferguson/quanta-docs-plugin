# Quanta Docs User Guide

**Quanta** Documents plugin is a powerful file system-based document editor that allows you to view, edit, and organize your documents and folders in a tree-like structure, similar to Jupyter Notebooks, but where each 'cell' is an actual file on the file system rather than a chunk of JSON in a monolithic document file like Jupyter uses. The app provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing your content, from simple text editing to advanced file operations, creating a Jupyter-like experience (block-based editor) but using your file system itself for storage.

## Getting Started

Using Quanta is much like browsing a File System, except that the content itself is being presented to you rather than just filenames. So Quanta is like a Wiki, or Document Editor/Publisher in that regard. Quanta presents your files and folders as a unified document view that you can browse around in. Each file in a folder is displayed as a separate section/cell, creating the appearance of one continuous document while maintaining individual file organization. At any given time you'll be viewing the content of a folder, but you'll be seeing all the markdown of all the files in that folder presented to you as a big editable document. So in the sense that you can edit online content this is similar to a Wiki.

### Navigation

#### Folder Navigation
- **Click on any folder** to navigate into it and view its contents
- **Use the Back button** in the header to return to the previous page
- **Parent folder navigation** - When viewing a subfolder, you can navigate up one level

#### File Structure

All files and folders use a 4-digit numeric prefix (e.g., "0001_", "0002_") that controls their display order. This numbering system ensures your content appears in a consistent, predictable sequence. When displayed to you, these numeric prefixes are hidden for a cleaner appearance.

## Viewing Modes

**Quanta** offers several viewing modes to suit different needs:

### Standard View Mode
In standard view, files are rendered as formatted Markdown content, providing a clean reading experience. Images are displayed inline with the text.

- Checkboxes appear next to each item for selection

Functions related to creating new files/folders are shown between each existing file/folder, so it's easy to insert new content at the correct ordinal where you want it.

A dropdown in the header allows you to adjust the content width:

- **Wide**: Expanded view for maximum content visibility

## Overall Page Layout

At the upper right of the page these are buttons for opening folders (if run locally only), followed by refresh, search, settings, report, and help buttons. Parent button takes you up one level on folder structure. These are general buttons about things at a higher level in the app.

When `Edit Mode` is enabled we get more buttons down the middle and on the right side of the page for various edit-related tasks.
